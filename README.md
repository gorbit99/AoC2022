Advent of Code 2022 all written in [Haku](https://codeberg.org/wimvanderbauwhede/haku), an experimental
Japanese functional programming language. This is mainly done as a challenge for myself.

Most solutions require my own patches (reachable [here](https://codeberg.org/Gorbit99/haku/src/branch/devel)). These
usually fix some small issues with the original implementation.
